# Greenhouse Client

This is the thing that's running on the Pi in the greenhouse that's interacting with the general IO on the board.  
Essentially, it's the thing that's making things happen - opening windows, valves, taking readings, etc.

## Start

```commandline
python3 main.py
```

This executes a loop that goes forever.
